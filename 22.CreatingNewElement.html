        function newParagraph(){
            //1. we have to create the element. using createElement("what element we want to create").
            var element=document.createElement("p");
            
            //2. Then think of DOM. as div whose id="main" is our element inside which we have p tags. so we have to get this main
            var main=document.getElementById("main");
            //3. now we will append our new element into div whose id ="main". becuase p is the child of div
            main.appendChild(element);
            //4. now we can add text to our paragraph. createTextNode("") is used to add text.
            var text=document.createTextNode("The Battle of Salamis was fought between an alliance of Greek citites and the Persian Empire in 480 BC. The Greeks decisively defeated the Persian navy.");
            //5. then we have to append this text node to p tag because its the child of p.
            element.appendChild(text);
        }

        <h2>AFTERMATH OF THE BATTLE OF CANNAE</h2>
        
            <p>After the horrific defeat at the Battle of Cannae, the Romans reinstituted Fabius' avoidance strategy. The Romans no longer refused to meet Hannibal in headd on collisions. Rather the Roman army kept a watchful eye on Hannibal, but always at a close distance.</p>
