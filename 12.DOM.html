<!-- In this lecture we will learn about Document Object Model 
1. Browser loads page.
2. DOM is created- objects that we can use that represents the HTML. Objects are stored in the DOM.
The DOM allows us to use our JavaScript code to access parts of the web page.

-->
<!-- Let's see the following code. -->

<!doctype html>

<html>

    <head><title>DOM</title></head>
    
    <body>
    
        <h1>Types of Fish</h1>
        <div id="section1">
        
            <p>The first fish...</p>
        </div>
        <div id="section2">
        <p>The second fish...</p>
        </div>
    
    </body>

</html>


<!-- now let's see the dom of above code: 


        document
            |
           html
            |
  ----------------------
 |                      |
head                   body
 |                      |
title           -----------------------------------
 |             |              |                    |
Fish Website   h1       div id="section1"  div id="section2"
               |              |                    |
            Types of Fish     p                    p
                              |                    |
                         The first fish        The second fish

<!-- 
so there are three types of nodes:
1. Element node- html, head, body, title, h1, div , p
2. Attribute node- id 
3. Text node- Fish Website, Types of fish, The first fish, The second fish
