# JavaScript
This is a Repository having my JavaScript code. In the start of my IT degree 5th semester(2020) I've taken initiative to learn and teach web design and development on my own(from youtube, google, or any courses etc). So, I've created a squad of almost 8-12 class fellows and we all started learning from very basics which includes html, css, bootstrap4, javaScript, jquery. So this repository contains all the files related to JavaScript that we've learned and practice at that time.
